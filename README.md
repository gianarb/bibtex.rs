`bibtex.rs` is a Rust library I wrote to play with the language (Rust).

I never wrote a parser before, and BibTex sounds like a small format I can play with.

I am trying to use commit title who are understandable and descriptive. And I
want to use git tag as checkpoint for long goal. My hope for this repository is
to act as learning material in the future.
